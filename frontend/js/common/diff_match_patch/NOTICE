The code is this directory is taking from the Google diff-match-patch library.

Link to repo: https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch

The license associated with diff-match-patch is located here in the file "LICENCE".

The only change I made from the origin code was that I replaced the last line of the file which was originially this:

```
this.diff_match_patch=diff_match_patch;this.DIFF_DELETE=DIFF_DELETE;this.DIFF_INSERT=DIFF_INSERT;this.DIFF_EQUAL=DIFF_EQUAL;
```

To this:

```
window.diff_match_patch=diff_match_patch;window.DIFF_DELETE=DIFF_DELETE;window.DIFF_INSERT=DIFF_INSERT;window.DIFF_EQUAL=DIFF_EQUAL;
```
