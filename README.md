# JAM

A live coding environment that allows realtime collaboration through a web browser.

Inspired by other live coding systems such as:
- [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)
- [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/)
- [Gibber](https://github.com/gibber-cc/gibber)

## Project Status

I just started working on this so basically nothing is implemented yet :(
